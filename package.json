  "description": "Docker Compose Deploy Control (**dcDeployControl**) is a microservice that parses `docker-compose.yml` files and dynamically creates a webinterface for deploying and visualizing containers and networks. The main purpose of the software is to create understandable visualizations over large docker composes aswell as managing execution of subsets of the docker-compose setup. Compared to a similar tool like WeaveScope, dcDeployControl does not require any priviliges and can create the visualizations without starting any containers. It does this by parsing the chosen docker-compose project and detecting containers, networks, port-forwarding and custom labels. The information is sent to frontend, where containers and networks are converted to nodes and edges in a network graph. The backend works as a wrapper for a DinD container wherefrom the frontend can get information about live running containers aswell as start and stopping containers defined in the chosen docker-compose file. The end-product is a neat, incredibly useful tool, compatible with any docker-compose managed project.",
